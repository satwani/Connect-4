# Connect-4
First Coding project

Connect 4 was my final project for my first ever programming class. I used Python and turtle.

# Description
Summary: Classes - Game, Win, Turtle_connect
	 Atrributes - 2 integers: rows and columns
                      2 floats: initial x and y coordinates
		      2 strings: red_file, yellow_file
	 Data structures used -  nestedlist, list, disctionaries
	 Non-class function - menu function in the driver file


# Notes:
 - I've tested all the methods and attributes for both classes expect methods 
that call other methods or call turtle. For testing all types of possible wins.
 - Player and computer turn are called from other functions and use different attributes from different methods.
 - I've limited the manual user inputs for rows and columns to between 4 and 9.
 - Limited at 9x9 for visual purposes even though my code work for any integer value.
